# Automated Bus Scheduling and Route Management System

##  Overview

The **Automated Bus Scheduling and Route Management System** is a web-based application designed to simplify and automate the scheduling of buses, drivers, and conductors while efficiently managing routes. The system reduces manual effort, avoids scheduling conflicts, and improves overall operational efficiency for transport authorities.

This project was developed with a clean UI, modular structure, and a focus on real-world usability for bus conductors and drivers.
